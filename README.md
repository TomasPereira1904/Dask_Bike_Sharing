This Project is an attempt to solve the Bike Sharing problem. The process will allow the prediction of daily number of counts

  dteday: Date
  season: Season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)

    d: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
  temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in      hourly scale)
  atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (    only in hourly scale)
  hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)
